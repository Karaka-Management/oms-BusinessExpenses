## Expenses

In the expenses tab you can create and see individual expenses for this expense report.

> Every expense should have it's own separate expense element.

The list shows all days of the expense period, even if no expenses are recorded for a certain day. However, these days are greyed out. Expenses that are outside of the expense period are highlighted in red.
